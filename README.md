This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First and foremost, you'll need to have npm installed on the computer that you're working on. Without that, there's no way to install the prerequisite libraries and projects. You can download Node and npm for your project at [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), then perform the following steps:

Find the appropriate installer package for your computer and operating system for Node and NPM at [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the instructions provided by the installer.
Install an appropriate code editor or Interactive Development Environment (IDE). I've had the best experiences with Visual Studio Code, so that gets my personal recommendation, but you can use anything you're comfortable with!
Once you've installed Node ...

Now, install project dependencies by running

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
